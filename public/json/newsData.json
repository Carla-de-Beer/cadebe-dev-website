      "text": "There are numerous online articles that describe how to configure AWS S3 in order to host a static website. In fact S3 makes this quite easy. However, many of these articles do not necessarily follow best practices, especially in terms of security requirements. And there are also a number of gotchas along the way to keep an eye on. I built a simple React JS website and deployed it onto AWS. This is how I did it.",
